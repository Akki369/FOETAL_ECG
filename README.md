# FOETAL_ECG
In this project our main goal is to extract the foetus heartbeat from the mothers heartbeat using Adaptive Noise Canceller(ANC) which is an adaptive filter. Here ANC is implemented in SISO and MISO. In which both the implementations extract the foetus signal using LMS, LLMS, and NLMS algorithms.
